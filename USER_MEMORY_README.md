# User Memory System for ISO 27001:2022 Auditor Agent

## Overview

The ISO 27001:2022 Auditor Agent now includes a comprehensive user memory system that provides personalized conversation history, learning progress tracking, and session management for each authenticated user.

## Features

### üîê User-Specific Memory
- **Persistent Storage**: All conversations are stored in a database linked to specific users
- **Session Management**: Users can have multiple conversation sessions
- **Context Awareness**: The agent remembers previous conversations within each session
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Learning progress is tracked across all user sessions

### üìä Learning Progress Tracking
- **Learning Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced based on conversation topics
- **Topic Coverage**: Tracks which ISO 27001:2022 topics have been discussed
- **Progress Analytics**: Provides insights into user's learning journey
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends next steps based on current knowledge

### üóÇÔ∏è Session Management
- **Multiple Sessions**: Users can create new conversations while preserving old ones
- **Session History**: Complete conversation history for each session
- **Session Summary**: AI-generated summaries of session content and focus areas
- **Session Deletion**: Users can clean up old sessions

## Architecture

### Database Models

#### User Model
```python
class User(Base):
    id: Primary key
    name: User's full name
    email: Unique email address
    organization_name: Company/organization
    domain: Industry domain
    location: Geographic location
    password_hash: Encrypted password
    created_at: Account creation timestamp
    updated_at: Last update timestamp
    conversations: Relationship to UserConversation
```

#### UserConversation Model
```python
class UserConversation(Base):
    id: Primary key
    user_id: Foreign key to User
    session_id: Unique session identifier
    query: User's question
    response: Agent's response
    timestamp: When the exchange occurred
    user: Relationship to User
```

### Service Layer

#### UserConversationService
- **store_conversation()**: Saves new conversation exchanges
- **get_user_conversations()**: Retrieves user's conversation history
- **get_session_conversations()**: Gets conversations for a specific session
- **create_user_memory()**: Creates LangChain memory with user context
- **get_user_conversation_summary()**: Analyzes conversation topics and focus
- **get_user_learning_progress()**: Tracks learning progress and suggests next steps
- **delete_user_session()**: Removes session data

## API Endpoints

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
cd backend
python setup_user_memory.py
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start authentication service
cd backend
python login.py

# Terminal 2: Start main agent service
cd backend
python main.py

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
cd frontend
streamlit run app_with_auth.py
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
cd backend
python test_user_memory.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Conversation
1. Login to the system
2. Type your first question about ISO 27001:2022
3. The system automatically creates a new session
4. Continue asking follow-up questions in the same session

### Starting a New Session
1. Click "üÜï New Conversation" in the sidebar
2. Ask a new question
3. A new session is created while preserving the old one

### Checking Your Progress
1. Click "üìä Show My Progress" in the sidebar
2. View your learning level and topics covered
3. See suggested next steps for continued learning

### Managing Sessions
1. Click "üìã My Sessions" to see all your conversations
2. View message counts and creation dates
3. Delete old sessions if needed

## Technical Details

### Memory Implementation
- **LangChain Integration**: Uses ConversationBufferWindowMemory for context
- **Database Persistence**: All conversations stored in PostgreSQL
- **User Isolation**: Complete separation between different users' data
- **Session Scoping**: Memory context limited to specific sessions

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Window**: Limited to last 20 exchanges per session
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Lazy Loading**: Memory loaded only when needed
- **Efficient Queries**: Minimal database calls for optimal performance

### Security Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user identification
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Session Security**: Session IDs are UUID-based and secure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Verify database credentials in `.env` file
- Ensure database exists and is accessible

#### Memory Not Persisting
- Verify database tables were created
- Check user authentication is working
- Ensure conversation service is properly initialized

#### Session Management Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check if JWT token is valid
- Verify backend services are running

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed learning path recommendations
- **Collaborative Learning**: Share insights between team members
- **Export Functionality**: Download conversation history and progress reports
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external learning management systems

### Performance Improvements
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based conversation caching
- **Async Processing**: Background conversation analysis
- **Smart Summarization**: AI-powered conversation summaries
- **Predictive Suggestions**: Proactive learning recommendations
